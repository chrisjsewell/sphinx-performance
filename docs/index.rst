Sphinx-Performance
==================

**Sphinx-Performance** is a Commandline tool to analyse the performance of different Sphinx documentation
project setups.

It was created to answer questions like:

* How good does Sphinx scale?
* Which impact has an extension to the build time?
* Is there any different between two specific versions?
* How huge is the benefit of using parallel build mode?
* Which are the performance bottlenecks during a Sphinx build?
